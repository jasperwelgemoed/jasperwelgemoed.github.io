title: Teaching Mars Rovers How to Classify Martian Terrain AI4Mars x NASA (2015)

## Aim of the project
AI4Mars is a citizen science project led by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory that aims to improve the ability of Mars rovers to navigate safely by teaching them to recognize different types of Martian terrain using machine learning. Inspired by past incidents where rovers like Spirit got stuck in sand, the project seeks to prevent such situations in future missions.

Because there’s no existing dataset for Martian terrain like there is for Earth imagery, the project relies on volunteers to label real images taken by Mars rovers. These labels will be used to create the first public benchmark for terrain classification on Mars, helping researchers train AI systems for autonomous rover navigation.

The ultimate goal is to make future uncrewed space exploration safer and more efficient by enabling rovers to identify safe terrain for driving, landing, and hibernation—all without human intervention.

## Method 
Manually adding boundaries to areas of interest with different categories of soil, terrain and rocks.

## Results
I managed to classify 837 images of Martian terrain. The project is finished now and all 700.000 images have been classified by the community!
