title: Feasability Research for a Space Telescope for Imaging Earth-like Exoplanets in the Mid-infrared. (2023)
description: "This project investigates the effects of prolonged droughts on water reservoirs in Andalucia, Spain, using remote sensing data. By analyzing satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, it tracks changes in water surface area and vegetation health over the past five years. The goal is to identify trends in water scarcity and environmental degradation and provide actionable insights to help prevent a looming water crisis in the region. The project combines spatial analysis with policy recommendations to raise awareness and encourage faster government response."
