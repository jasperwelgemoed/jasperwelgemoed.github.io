## Aim of the project
The aim of this project is to develop a small-scale, low-budget agricultural tool-switching mechanism compatible with the Mirte Master robot, specifically optimized for greenhouse conditions. The goal is to enable the robot to switch between different tools autonomously, addressing challenges such as precision limitations, moisture and dirt resistance, and cost-efficiency, ultimately improving the robotâ€™s functionality for owners of smaller greenhouses.


## Method
The methodology of this project follows a structured NASA systems engineering and project management approach, broken down into seven distinct phases, each with specific objectives and deliverables to ensure systematic progress and integration. These phases include:

| **Phase**                                         | **Description**                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pre-Phase A â€“ Mission Study**                  | Identifying stakeholders, refining the project scope, and formulating a clear mission need statement. |
| **Phase A â€“ Concept Development**                | Analyzing the previous design, defining system-level requirements, and generating multiple design concepts. |
| **Phase B â€“ Preliminary Design**                 | Selecting the most promising concept through trade-offs and testing early prototypes using 3D printing. |
| **Phase C â€“ Detailed Design**                    | Finalizing the design for manufacturing, including CAD models and connection definitions.         |
| **Phase D/E â€“ Production, Testing, and Final Iteration** | Manufacturing the system, conducting integration with the parallel group, and performing functional and performance tests. |
| **Phase F â€“ Verification and Documentation**     | Verifying requirement compliance and compiling the final report.                                  |


This phased methodology ensures a well-documented, collaborative, and test-driven development process for creating a functional tool-switching mechanism.

## Key Result
## âœ… Summary of Results

- **Repeatability**  
  - Achieved **99.5%** success rate with 100g tools  
  - Achieved **97.8%** success rate with 300g tools  
  - Significant improvement over last yearâ€™s system (**83.1%** repeatability)

- **Cycle Time**  
  - Reduced tool-switching time to **9.8 seconds**  
  - Meets the target to be faster than a human (previous time was 20 seconds)

- **Mass Optimization**  
  - Total system mass reduced by **46%** (from 74g to 40g)  
  - Allows for heavier tools (up to 300g)

- **Precision and Accuracy**  
  - Tests informed design tolerances for successful docking  
  - Adjusted tolerances ensure successful tool switching in **>99%** of cases

- **Environmental Resistance**  
  - Improved **moisture** and **dirt** protection (covered electronics, anti-dirt features)  
  - Greenhouse testing still needed for full validation

- **Cost Efficiency**  
  - Total cost of the system: **â‚¬50**  
  - Well below the â‚¬150 budget limit

- **Compatibility & Scalability**  
  - Fully compatible with the **Mirte Master** platform  
  - Easily **scalable and maintainable** for future use and different greenhouse setups
