title: Developing a Technological System to Assist Volleybal Referees and Improve Fair Play (2018) 
description: For our final high school project (Profielwerkstuk), we developed a technological solution aimed at improving fairness in professional volleyball by assisting referees in making more accurate decisions. Our project addresses common issues such as misjudged touchÃ© balls and unclear in/out callsâ€”errors that often lead to frustration, disputes, and unfair gameplay.

## Aim of the project
We designed and prototyped a smart volleyball system that combines pressure sensors, conductive materials, and microcontrollers (Arduino) to detect contact and boundary violations in real time. The system transmits data wirelessly to an external device, which visualizes sensor signals and helps referees make faster, more objective decisions. Through interviews with professional referees and research into current technologies like the Challenge System and Hawk-Eye, we identified limitations in existing solutions and used this insight to design a simpler, more accessible system.

## Method
By making the outer surface of the volleybal touch sensitive, we could detect voltage spikes and with software could detect whether a touch was made in the block. On top of that we added a conductive layer on top of the volleyball which would close a circuit when it came in contact with the lines.

## Results
We succesfully presented our idea to the NEVOBO (Dutch Volleyball Association), we were nominated for best high-school project of 2018 by the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen (KNAW).
