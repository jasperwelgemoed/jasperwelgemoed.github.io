## Aim of the project

The aim of the Stratos V project is to design, build, test, launch to space, recover, and re-launch a refurbishable, liquid bi-propellant rocket to demonstrate the feasibility of reusable and sustainable launch vehicles in student and amateur rocketry. The 2022/23 team specifically focuses on preliminary and detailed design as well as testing selected subsystems, laying the foundation for future teams to achieve full reusability and break DAREâ€™s internal altitude record of 12.5km.

## Method

To realize the mission of developing a reusable launch vehicle, I set up a structured systems-engineering-driven approach. The planning and development process is based on the **NASA Systems Engineering Handbook**, which divides the project into **seven phases**: from Pre-Phase A (concept studies) to Phase F (closeout).

My task as chief systems engineer was to ensure the engineers could do what they were hired for, their own specific engineering task. My task was to be the glue between the different departments and engineers to ensure the functional requirements for the project would be validated and verified and that the team kept their eyes on the same end-goal. I ensured this by setting up multiple methods for the team to use.

- **Team Organization**: First I setup the team structure using a **matrix management structure**, dividing members into departments and sections with shared responsibilities. This enabled clear communication paths and division of tasks across all subsystems.

- **Phased Development**: Then I broke up the project into logical phases (Pre-Phase A to F), each with clear goals, decision points, and deliverables. Early phases focus on feasibility, requirements, and design, while later ones cover fabrication, testing, operations, and decommissioning. I setup daily meetings to keep track of the department their progress during each phase.

- **Requirement-Driven Design**: One of my main responsibilities was to ensure that all design decisions made by the engineers where in line with our mission. With a project this size, we had over 800 requirements. To keep track of the requirement's validation and verification, I yielded a sponsorship from Valispace and setup an online requirement tracking tool tailored to our project. Under my guidance the team defined clear **Mission** and **Stakeholder Requirements** to guide all activities. These include technical goals (e.g., reusability, altitude targets), documentation, safety compliance, budget constraints, and stakeholder communication.

- **Work Planning Tools**: One of the major challenges for this project for me was to keep track of people's work progress and ensure that it contributed to the mission. To assist me and the engineers with this, I created a centralized database for engineers to update their status on their work progress and a place for them to create workpackages. I setup a Notion page with databases for storing documentation, sources, meeting minutes, CAD files, finances and deadlines. I created tutorial videos for the team to watch to get them up to speed with using the tool. In the same place people could find a set of **Work Flow Diagrams (WFDs)** and **Work Breakdown Structures (WBSs)** that I created together with the engineers for each project phase, allowing for top-down planning. This was supplemented by **Gantt charts** that show timelines, task durations, and milestones.

- **Knowledge Transfer**: One of the biggest challenges of previous stratos projects, was that there was too little documentation done througout the project. This meant our team had to re-invent the wheel, which cost us loads of time. My responsibility was to provide a smooth transistion from the 2022/2023 team to the 2023/2024 team through a detailed hand-over.

- **Risk and Resource Management**: Together with the operations manager I was responsible for the risk and resource management during the project. So for each test-campaign we set up, we had to setup multiple risk mitigation strategies. I made templates for **SWOT and organizational risk analysis** for each department.


## Results Summary

After one year of fulltime working on this project we managed to design & print a new rocket engine, test it, create detailed designs for almost every sub-component of the rocket.
