## Aim of the project
In my free time I like to be creative with modelling and 3D printing. It started of as having no idea what to gift my friends for their birthday and now the friends of my friends want the same gift. So I decided to make a small business out of it. People send me their photo's and I turn them into a 3D printable image called a lithophane using existing software. 

## Method
Using solidworks I modelled the products and using my own 3D printer I fabricated them.

## Results so far
I have created 2 lithophane shaped boxes with lights in them, ready to be sold. Currently I have not sold any lithophanes as I am still in the design phase of the lithophanes themself. I only gifted them to my friends and got positive feedback. I also managed to create a colored lithophane.

## Plans
- Creating a website (webshop) for people to upload their photo's to and order a lithophane.
- Invest in an extra 3D printer to keep up with the demand.
- Create instagram account for promotion
