## Aim of the project
In my free time I like to be creative with modelling and 3D printing. It started of as having no idea what to gift my friends for their birthday and now the friends of my friends want the same gift. So I decided to make a small business out of it. People send me their photo's and I turn them into a 3D printable image called a lithophane using existing software. 

## Method
Using solidworks I modelled the products and using my own 3D printer I fabricated them. 


<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start;">

</div>

## Results so far
Currently I have not sold any lithophanes as I am still in the design phase. I only gifted them to my friends and got positive feedback.

## Plans
Creating a website (webshop) for people to upload their photo's to and order a lithophane.
Invest in an extra 3D printer to keep up with the demand.
