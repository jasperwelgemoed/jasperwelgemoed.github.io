## Aim of the project

The aim of the project was to develop an autonomous apple-picking robot to support the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger. The robot was designed to assist UNity Orchardâ€”an ecological apple farm facing labor shortages and harsh working conditionsâ€”by autonomously navigating the orchard, detecting and picking ripe apples, and communicating its status to the farmer, all while minimizing disruption and ensuring safe operation in a dynamic environment.

## Method
### Method Summary

The method consisted of designing, implementing, and integrating a ROS 2-based software system for an autonomous apple-picking robot, guided by a structured functional architecture.

A **functional hierarchy** was created with six core parent functions:

1. Perceive environment  
2. Navigate around orchard  
3. Detect apples  
4. Manage gripper  
5. Communicate with farmer  
6. Manage exceptions  

These were decomposed into child functions and visualized using a **SysML block diagram**, an **NÂ² chart**, and a **functional flow diagram** with swimlanes to show node responsibilities.

Each function was implemented via dedicated or shared ROS 2 nodes:

- **SLAM Toolbox** was used to map the environment and localize the robot on a static map.
- A custom **EmergencyBrakeCheck** node read sonar data to perform emergency braking when dynamic obstacles (e.g. workers, animals) were detected within 20 cm.
- The **NavPlanner** node used the `nav2` stack with a SMAC lattice planner, restricted to spin-and-forward motion for simpler obstacle avoidance.
- The **AppleDetection** node used **YOLOv8** (via Ultralytics) and **OpenCV** to detect ripe apples using RGB images from both base and gripper-mounted cameras.
- The **GripperPlanner** node calculated inverse kinematics-based trajectories for the robotic arm and controlled the gripperâ€™s grasping and placing behavior.
- A **Tkinter-based GUI** was built in the **FarmerInterface** node, allowing the farmer to issue commands (start, stop, return) and monitor robot status.
- A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** node coordinated node activation and transitions, managing operational flow and top-level exceptions.

The robotâ€™s operational loop was:

1. Navigate to a detected tree  
2. Detect apples  
3. Pick apple  
4. Navigate to basket  
5. Place apple  
6. Update farmer and repeat  

Fallback logic was implemented for failed detections, dropped apples, and low battery scenarios. This modular and hierarchical approach ensured robust autonomous operation in a dynamic orchard environment, aligned with the systemâ€™s functional requirements and sustainable agriculture goals.

### Results Summary

A total of **12 system-level tests (T1â€“T12)** were conducted to validate the robotâ€™s functionality against the defined requirements. Out of these, **10 tests passed successfully**, demonstrating strong performance in perception, manipulation, and communication. Two tests (T3 and T10) related to navigation did not pass due to incomplete integration of the `nav2` stack with the MIRTE robot.

#### Successful Validations

- **Startup and System Readiness:**  
  The robot initialized correctly, handled state transitions reliably, and maintained clear communication with the farmer via a responsive GUI.

- **Localization and State Awareness:**  
  The robot accurately localized itself with <5 cm error using a Monte Carlo particle filter and successfully detected basket positions.

- **Camera Perception and Object Detection:**  
  Apple detection reached 90% accuracy within 2 meters, and relative position estimates had average errors of 1.5â€“2 cm.

- **Manipulation:**  
  Apple picking and placement achieved success rates above 85%, with reliable arm retraction behavior.

#### Unsuccessful Tests

- **Autonomous Navigation (T3):**  
  Although effective in simulation, the robot could not perform goal-directed navigation in real-world conditions due to incomplete `nav2` integration.  

- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance (T10):**  
  While the robot successfully detected nearby obstacles and triggered alerts, it could not replan or resume navigation paths autonomously.
