title: Feasability Study for a Space Telescope for Imaging Earth-like Exoplanets in the Mid-infrared (2023)
description: "This project researched a conceptual space mission aimed at detecting and characterizing 25 temperate, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars using mid-infrared interferometry. Developed in collaboration with Netherlands Institute for Space Research, NLR, ESA and SRON. The mission focuses on designing a formation-flying telescope array operating near the Sun-Earth L2 point. We explored the technical feasibility and system designâ€”covering spacecraft configuration, attitude control, thermal systems, propulsion, data handling, and telecommunications. Leveraging technologies from missions like the James Webb Space Telescope and ESAâ€™s Darwin, the goal of the mission aims to expand the search for habitable worlds and the potential for extraterrestrial life."

## Aim of the project
During this project me and a group of 3 others aimed to perform a top-level mission design of a mid-infrared space-based interferometer capable of detecting and characterizing 25 temperate, Earth-like exoplanets around nearby Sun-like stars. By using nulling interferometry from a formation-flying telescope array positioned near the Sun-Earth L2 point, the mission tries to directly observe the thermal emission of exoplanets in the 6â€“25â€¯Î¼m wavelength range. This enables the identification of key atmospheric biomarkers such as COâ‚‚, Hâ‚‚O, CHâ‚„, and Oâ‚ƒ, which are essential for assessing planetary habitability and the potential presence of life. 

## Method
Our mission concept uses a formation of four collector spacecraft and one beam combiner spacecraft flying in a controlled configuration near the Sun-Earth L2 point. These spacecraft perform nulling interferometry in the mid-infrared range (6â€“25â€¯Î¼m) to suppress starlight and isolate the thermal emission from exoplanets. The collector telescopes gather light from target stars and direct it to the central beam combiner via optical delay lines. By precisely adjusting optical path differences and maintaining formation accuracy through our chosen micro-propulsion and attitude control systems, the interferometer achieves the high contrast needed to detect faint planetary signals. Observations are planned over several years, with data processed to extract atmospheric spectra and identify biosignatures.

## Results
We succesfully presented our final mission design in front of researchers and a jury of the Netherlands Institute for Space Research. For details about the designed systems please see the **Project Documentation**.
