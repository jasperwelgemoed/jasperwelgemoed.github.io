title: Remote Sensing used to monitor the effect of droughts on water levels in the water reservoirs in the region of Andalucia in Spain.
description: "This project investigates the effects of prolonged droughts on water reservoirs in Andalucia, Spain, using remote sensing data. By analyzing satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, it tracks changes in water surface area and vegetation health over the past five years. The goal is to identify trends in water scarcity and environmental degradation and provide actionable insights to help prevent a looming water crisis in the region. The project combines spatial analysis with policy recommendations to raise awareness and encourage faster government response."

## Aim of the project

The aim of this project is to **analyze the impact of droughts on the water levels in reservoirs across the Andalucia region in Spain over the past five years** using **remote sensing techniques**. The study specifically focuses on:

- **Monitoring changes in the surface area** of the five largest water reservoirs using **Sentinel-2 visual spectrum data**.
- **Assessing vegetation health** using the **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** derived from Near Infrared and Red bands.
- **Identifying trends** in water depletion and vegetation decline to **predict future water scarcity** and **raise awareness** among policymakers.

Ultimately, the project seeks to **inform and urge the Andalucian government** to take **immediate and effective action** to combat the ongoing drought and **prevent a full-blown water crisis** in the region.
